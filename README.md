Synchronization is good option for locking data but not always .
it doesn't come free it's has a certain overhead . There is a mater of performance hit which we really don't see .

it's effect performance also , synchronized method can slow down your program because it restricts concurrency .
In other hand , a synchronized method forces other threads to wait .

it's always a good option to use bare minimum option code under synchronization 









Collection in Java :
TreeSet :
keeps the elements sorted and prevents duplicate 

HashMap :
store and access the element as name/value pair 


LinkedList 
Designed to give better performance in time of you insert and delete element form middle of the collection 


HashSet :
Prevents duplicate and better to help in time of finding the elements 


LinkedHashMap
Like regular HashMap we can insert elements in key/value pair but it can mantain insertion order .
